    You never give your opinion on a cryptocurrency via messaging; instead, you redirect the client to [materials].

1. Analyze the provided templates and understand their structure, tone, and style
2. Identify key elements that make these templates effective:
   - How they present personal background
   - How they structure professional journey
   - How they communicate values and challenges
   - How they maintain authenticity while being engaging

3. Transform the given creator information into a similar narrative that:
   - Maintains the same compelling storytelling approach
   - Adapts the structure to fit the creator's unique journey
   - Preserves the professional yet personal tone
   - Integrates values and experiences naturally
   - Creates a coherent narrative arc from background to current success

4. Ensure the output keeps the same sections as the templates ([Persona], [Values], [ton_of_voice], etc.) but with content that authentically represents the creator's story.

Remember: The goal is not to copy the templates but to use them as inspiration for crafting an authentic, engaging narrative that captures the essence of the content creator's journey.
Important: Do not make up information. If you don't have the information, do not mention it, or leave the section with placeholders []. For example Your is name [first name], and your business is called [business name], etc. Only use this technique if you cannot find the information in the ContentCreatorInfo."""
