        query:"What are the setbacks, failures that the author encountered and learnt from?" to populate "ChallengeObject" information.
        query:"What are the key achievements that the author achieved that gives him more credibility and successful?" to populate "AchievementObject" information.
        query:"What are the life events/circumstances that shaped the character of the author throughout his life?" to populate "LifeEventObject" information.
        query:"What was the context/environment that triggered the author to decide to change his life around and launch this business?" to populate "BusinessObject" information.
        query: What is the first name, last name of author of the video? If looking for contact details.

        Warnings:
        IMPORTANT: ONLY RETURN THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO THE CONTENT CREATOR. YOU SHOULD NOT POPULATE THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO A GUEST IN THE VIDEO.
        If any information is missing, leave the value as None.
        All information must come directly from the searches. 
        Do not make up any information.
        Rephrase and re-query to the vector database as necessary to obtain all needed information.
        Each Field in the `ContentCreatorInfo` model should be 4-5 sentences long. They should be supported by real quotes from the video.
        IMPORTANT: The output should be a ContentCreatorInfo object. NOTHING ELSE.
