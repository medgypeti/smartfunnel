        query:"What are the setbacks, failures that the author encountered and learnt from?" to populate "ChallengeObject" information.
        query:"What are the key achievements that the author achieved that gives him more credibility and successful?" to populate "AchievementObject" information.
        query:"What are the life events/circumstances that shaped the character of the author throughout his life?" to populate "LifeEventObject" information.
        query:"What was the context/environment that triggered the author to decide to change his life around and launch this business?" to populate "BusinessObject" information.
        query: What is the first name, last name of author of the video? If looking for contact details.

        If any information is missing, leave the value as None.
        All information must come directly from the searches. 
        Do not make up any information.
        Rephrase and re-query to the vector database as necessary to obtain all needed information.
        Each Field in the `ContentCreatorInfo` model should be 4-5 sentences long. They should be supported by real quotes from the video.
        IMPORTANT: The output should be a ContentCreatorInfo object. NOTHING ELSE.
        IMPORTANT: if {youtube_channel_handle} not found, DO NOT use tool, and move on to the next task.

        You will pass queries to the tool "Query Vector DB" to populate the `ContentCreatorInfo` model. 
        Here is an example of the queries you should pass: "What are the values/lessons that the author transmits throughout the video that makes him likeable, trustworthy?" to populate "ValueObject" information.
        IMPORTANT: Move to the next task if {youtube_channel_handle} is NOT found. DO NOT try to guess or figure out the name of an account.               
        Query guidelines to pass to the "Query Vector DB" tool to populate the `ContentCreatorInfo` model:
        query:"What are the values/lessons that the author transmits throughout the video that makes him likeable, trustworthy?" if you want to gather "ValueObject" information.
        query:"What are the setbacks, failures that the author encountered and learnt from?" if you want to populate "ChallengeObject" information.
        query:"What are the key achievements that the author achieved that gives him more credibility and successful?" if you want to populate "AchievementObject" information.
        query:"What are the life events/circumstances that shaped the character of the author throughout his life?" if you want to populate "LifeEventObject" information.
        query:"What was the context/environment that triggered the author to decide to change his life around and launch this business?" if you want to populate "BusinessObject" information.
        query: What is the first name, last name of author of the video? If looking for contact details.
        query: "What is the context within which the author started his business?" if you want to populate "BusinessObject" information.
        query: "What are the tips mentioned in the video that I can implement to grow my business?" if you want to populate "BusinessObject" information.
        query: "What are the key characteristics of the business of the author and the services I can buy from him?" if you want to gather "BusinessObject" information.

        Warnings:
        IMPORTANT: The output should be a ContentCreatorInfo object. NOTHING ELSE.
        You should run different queries based on the information you are looking for.
        All information must come directly from the searches. 
        Do not make up any information.
        Be thorough and creative in your search for missing data.
        You need to gather enough information about the content creator to be able to write 3000 words about them.
        IMPORTANT: ONLY RETURN THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO THE CONTENT CREATOR. YOU SHOULD NOT POPULATE THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO A GUEST IN THE VIDEO.
