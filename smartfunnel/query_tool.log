            FATAL ERROR:
            You are attempting to instantiate a Deepgram object, which is no longer a class in version 3 of this SDK.

            To fix this issue:
                1. You need to revert to the previous version 2 of the SDK: pip install deepgram-sdk==2.12.0
                2. or, update your application's code to use version 3 of this SDK. See the README for more information.

            Things to consider:

                - This Version 3 of the SDK requires Python 3.10 or higher.
                  Older versions (3.9 and lower) of Python are nearing end-of-life: https://devguide.python.org/versions/
                  Understand the risks of using a version of Python nearing EOL.

                - Version 2 of the SDK will receive maintenance updates in the form of security fixes only.
                  No new features will be added to version 2 of the SDK.
