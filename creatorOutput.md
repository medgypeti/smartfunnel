Be thorough and creative in your search for missing data. You need to gather enough information about the content creator to be able to write 3000 words about them. IMPORTANT: ONLY RETURN THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO THE CONTENT CREATOR. YOU SHOULD NOT POPULATE THE INFO IF IT RELATES TO A GUEST IN THE VIDEO.\nPrompt guidelines to populate the `ContentCreatorInfo` model: query:"What are the values/lessons that the author transmits throughout the video that makes him likeable, trustworthy?" if you want to gather "ValueObject" information. query:"What are the setbacks, failures that the author encountered and learnt from?" if you want to gather "ChallengeObject" information. query:"What are the key achievements that the author achieved that gives him more credibility and successful?" if you want to gather "AchievementObject" information. query:"What are the life events/circumstances that shaped the character of the author throughout his life?" if you want to gather "LifeEventObject" information. query:"What was the context/environment that triggered the author to decide to change his life around and launch this business?" if you want to gather "BusinessObject" information. query: What is the first name, last name of author of the video? If looking for contact details. query: "What is the context within which the author started his business?" if you want to gather "BusinessObject" information. query: "What are the tips mentioned in the video that I can implement to grow my business?" if you want to gather "BusinessObject" information. query: "What are the key characteristics of the business of the author and the services I can buy from him?" if you want to gather "BusinessObject" information. If looking for information as a whole doesn\'t work, \n    look for each item individually.\nWhen looking for a first name individually, search for phrases like, \n    "my name is", "hey guys, it\'s", \n    and other phrases a person would use to introduce themselves.\nWhen looking for an email, search for phrases like, \n    "you can contact me at", "my email is".\n\nIMPORTANT: The output should be a ContentCreatorInfo object.
